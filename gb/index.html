							<h2>What is this engine?</h2>
							<p>This engine was made for simple graphics app making, and even for games.</p>
							<p>GameBreaker was written on C++ and uses SDL2 and SoLoud libraries.</p>
							
							<h2>Why this engine was made?</h2>
							<p>My first games were made on GameMaker, but it got very uncomfortable for me.</p>
							<p>GameBreaker was inspired by GameMaker, nearly all of the basic functions from GM were ported to GB.</p>
							<p>So, like `draw_rectangle()` from GameMaker is `graphics::draw::rect()` in GameBreaker.</p>
							
							<h2>What abilities this engine has?</h2>
							<p>GameBreaker is very similar to GameMaker, it has objects, rooms, sprites, fonts, ds_lists,</p>
							<p>window maniupulation functions, dialogs and, very important, simplicity.</p>
							
							<h2>Examples</h2>
							<p>The very easy example of "Hello, world!" made with GB.</p>
							<p>Project structure should look like <a href="code.txt">in this file.</a>></p>
